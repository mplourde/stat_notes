Type of Study

    observational, prospective. Can only establish association
    
    no random sampling: sites not randomly selected
        not generalizable
    no random assignment: treatments are not randomly assigned to sites
        no causal inference
    unbalanced
        unequal number of replicates for each treatment

Linear model

    Assumptions on response:
        unit treatment additivity
        Y|A=a_i, B=b_j ~ N(mu + alpha_i + beta_j, sigma^2)
    Assumptions on samples
        Balanced cells
        independent replicates
    Assumptions on error term
        e_ijk ~ N(0, sigma^2)
            check homogeneity of variance
                graphical:
                    
                statistical:
                    
            check normality
                qqplot of studentized residuals
